# Endless-Splits

One day, I saw [this animation](https://i.imgur.com/aJEkrAn.gifv). I thought it was neat! Then I decided to make some code to do it myself. This is the result.

Besides just looking cool, there are some controls to manipulate the procedural animation.

* The SPACE BAR pauses and resumes the animation.
* The LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys decrease and increase the duration of each split.
* The DOWN and UP arrow keys slow down and speed up the speed of each split (by halving and doubling it).
* The CTRL key toggles forcing new splits to intersect the center or not.
* The C key counts the number of lines currently held in memory.

Endless Splits requires OpenGL and SDL2 to compile and run.

A precompiled executable is included.

You may be required to download the SDL2.dll to the same folder to allow it to run, which is included in the directory.

(Alternatively, you can [download it here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), for a more trustworthy source!)
